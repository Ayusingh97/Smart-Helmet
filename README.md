# Smart-Helmet
APPLICATIONS :

1)The circuit in helmet is designed such that the bike wont start unless the biker wears the helmet ,hasnâ€™t consumed alcohol and a correct password is entered through the smart helmet app.

2)If alcohol is detected, the buzzer gets on for sometime and a list of taxi services is showcased on the smart helmet app.

3)In case of accident, the GPS system installed with the smart helmet will globally locate the biker and an immediate call and message will be sent to the emergency contacts and the local authorities.

4)The password detector system can be used to automate the ignition locking process, so the user need not carry the ignition lock keys along with him.
